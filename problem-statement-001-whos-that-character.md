# 🕵️ Who’s That Character?

Build a **scalable, modular pipeline** to extract clean, structured metadata from a noisy, large-scale dataset of character images or textual descriptions.

This isn’t a toy problem. Imagine dealing with **millions of messy, inconsistently labeled character entries**, and needing to create a foundation layer for training our next-gen character generation models. If the pipeline breaks at 5M samples — it doesn’t work.

## 📦 Dataset Realities

You’ll be working with large-scale datasets that may include:

* **Character images** in various art styles and qualities
* **Textual descriptions** of characters, ranging from concise tags to full prompts
* Real-world inconsistencies:

  * Missing or conflicting attribute data
  * Multiple characters in the same image
  * Noisy or ambiguous tags (e.g., “cool” as both mood and fashion)

Start with this open dataset:
🔗 - https://huggingface.co/datasets/cagliostrolab/860k-ordered-tags

Feel free to use additional sources — but assume that the end goal is to **scale to \~5M entries**.

## 🧩 The Goal

Extract the following **structured attributes** for each character (from an image or description):

* **Age** (child, teen, young adult, middle-aged, elderly)
* **Gender** (male, female, non-binary)
* **Ethnicity** (Asian, African, Caucasian, etc.)
* **Hair Style** (ponytail, curly, bun, etc.)
* **Hair Color** (black, blonde, red, etc.)
* **Hair Length** (short, medium, long)
* **Eye Color** (brown, blue, green, etc.)
* **Body Type** (slim, muscular, curvy...)
* **Dress** (casual, traditional, formal...)
* **Optional**: facial expression, accessories, scars, tattoos, etc.

### 🔍 Edge Case Rule

If an image contains multiple characters, you can skip it or flag it as ambiguous. Focus only on clean, **single-character extractions**.

## 🔁 Output Format

Return each character's attributes in a clean, machine-readable format:

```json
{
  "Age": "Young Adult",
  "Gender": "Female",
  "Ethnicity": "Asian",
  "Hair Style": "Ponytail",
  "Hair Color": "Black",
  "Hair Length": "Long",
  "Eye Color": "Brown",
  "Body Type": "Slim",
  "Dress": "Green Yukata"
}
```

This format will be used to train generative models that take this schema and produce corresponding images.

## 🚚 Deliverables

Build and submit **one of** the following:

### Option 1: 🖥 Gradio App

Upload an image, view extracted attributes.

### Option 2: 📓 Jupyter Notebook

Walk through the pipeline with sample inputs and visualizations.

Either version should include:

* The **core pipeline code**
* Working demo with 10–50 sample records
* A brief write-up on how it would scale to 5M samples

## 🔍 What We’re Evaluating

This task is **not** about a perfect classifier. It’s about building a robust, scalable pipeline that:

### ✅ Scales to \~5M samples

* Batches, caching, streaming, or parallelization where needed
* Resilient to partial failure or bad inputs
* Avoids blowing up RAM or GPU usage

### 🧱 Is Modular and Maintainable

* Easy to plug in new attributes or switch detection backends
* Swappable components (e.g., replace CLIP with BLIP2 or llama3)
* Clean interface for downstream model training

### 🎯 Is Reasonably Accurate and Consistent

* Does the output follow the schema?
* Does it capture a consistent visual identity?

## 🧠 Bonus Points

* Preprocessing for **style normalization** or **occlusion handling**
* Custom logic to resolve ambiguous cases
* Cleaning & clustering to dedupe near-duplicate entries
* Distributed data processing strategies (e.g., Ray, Dask, Apache Beam)
* Easy-to-deploy or cloud-ready architecture (Docker, HuggingFace Spaces, etc.)

> 💡 Tip: Build like it’s going into production — not like it’s staying in a Colab notebook.

## 🧱 Architecture Suggestions

This is an open-ended problem — and that’s intentional. But here are some ideas and best practices to help you think about how this pipeline might scale in the real world:

### 🧩 1. Modular Design

Break your pipeline into **clearly defined stages**. For example:

```
[Input Loader] → [Preprocessing] → [Attribute Extractor] → [Postprocessing & Validation] → [Exporter]
```

Each stage should be independently testable and replaceable.

### 🔍 2. Model Choices

Depending on your approach (image vs text input), you could explore:

* **Image Embedding + Classifier**

  * Use CLIP, BLIP, or DINOv2 to extract embeddings
  * Train lightweight classifiers for each attribute
* **Text-to-Tag Parsers**

  * Use LLMs (LLaMA3, Claude, etc.) to extract tags from unstructured text
* **Vision-Language Models**

  * Try BLIP2 or Kosmos for caption + tag generation from image input
* **Zero-shot Methods**

  * Start with zero-shot classification using CLIP similarity
  * Iterate with fine-tuned adapters (e.g., LoRA heads for tagging)

### ⚙️ 3. Processing at Scale

5M samples is not trivial. Think about:

* **Batch inference** using PyTorch Datasets or HuggingFace `datasets.map()`
* **Distributed processing** with:

  * 🧠 [Ray](https://docs.ray.io/en/latest/) — simple, Python-native parallelism
  * 🛠 [Dask](https://www.dask.org/) — for dataframe-style processing
  * 🐍 Multiprocessing + chunked IO (if you're keeping it lightweight)

Cache intermediate results (like embeddings) using:

* Redis / SQLite for prototyping
* Parquet or Arrow for storage-backed processing

### ☁️ 4. Deployment & Tools

If you want to go beyond notebooks:

* **Gradio** or **Streamlit** for quick interactive demos
* **FastAPI** for building an endpoint layer
* **Celery** or **RQ** for background job queues
* **Docker** to package your app for portability

### 💾 5. Output Storage

Make sure your results are structured and easy to consume:

* Store in **CSV**, **JSONL**, or **SQLite/Postgres**
* Consider adding a **data schema or manifest** for consistency
* Optionally group results by dataset/image ID for traceability

### 🧼 6. Preprocessing & Cleaning

This often makes or breaks performance at scale:

* Filter/flag images with multiple people using object detectors (YOLO, Segment Anything)
* Normalize images for lighting, size, cropping
* Use OCR / vision-language alignment to clean mislabeled entries
* Cluster visually similar characters to reduce redundancy

## 🛠️ TL;DR: Your Tech Stack Might Look Like...

```plaintext
Data: HuggingFace Datasets, Custom Scraper
Model: CLIP + XGBoost | BLIP2 | OpenCLIP + LoRA
Infra: Python + PyTorch + Ray | Docker + Gradio
Storage: JSONL / SQLite / Parquet
Deployment (Optional): FastAPI + Celery + Redis
```

Build what works — just make sure it **scales**, **fails gracefully**, and **leaves room to grow**.
