# 🎨 Make a Multimodal AI  
*Generate Stylized Art + Captions from a Single Seed*

---

## 🚀 Overview

You're building an AI system that blends creativity and cognition — a **multimodal model** that generates:

- 🖼️ An **image** in a specific artistic style (e.g., oil painting, sculpture, engraving)  
- ✍️ A **caption** that accurately describes that exact image  

From a single **random seed**, your model should output both — as one unified generative process.

## 🎯 Your Mission

Design a model that can:

1. Generate an **image** in a chosen art style  
2. Simultaneously generate a **caption** for the generated image  
3. Do both from a **shared seed** or latent input — not a two-step pipeline  

This task is about creating a **joint generative model**, where both outputs are derived from the same core representation.

---

## 🧠 What You’ll Build

### ✅ 1. Style Selection & Dataset Prep

Choose a single artistic medium or style from the dataset (e.g., engravings, watercolor paintings, sculptures). Then:

- Clean, resize, and normalize your dataset  
- Use a captioning model (e.g. BLIP2) to create descriptive text for each image  
- Align image-caption pairs for training your model

---

### ✅ 2. Unified Multimodal Generator (Image + Caption from a Single Seed)

Create a **single model or tightly integrated system** that, given a random seed, generates:

- 🖼️ A stylized **image**  
- ✍️ A **caption** grounded in that exact image  

This is **not** a two-stage pipeline (e.g., image → caption). Both outputs should come **from the same latent input**, reflecting shared semantics.

---

### 💡 Suggested Architectures

- **Latent Diffusion Model + Text Decoder**  
  - Use a latent diffusion backbone to generate images  
  - Add a transformer head to decode the text directly from the same latent vector

- **GAN-style Generator + Captioning Head**  
  - Extend StyleGAN or VQGAN to produce a paired text embedding  
  - Train both with a shared noise vector

- **Multimodal Token Stream Model**  
  - Inspired by DALL·E or Flamingo: decode both image and caption from one input  
  - Leverage shared embeddings and transformer blocks

- **Contrastive Latent Mapping**  
  - Generate both outputs from the same seed and align them in a shared latent space  
  - Optionally train using a contrastive or CLIP-like loss

### 🔁 Pseudocode Example

```python
# Unified forward pass from a single seed
seed = get_random_seed()
image, caption = multimodal_model(seed)

return {
  "image": image,
  "caption": caption
}
````

> Bonus if the caption reflects the style or subject matter (e.g., “a bronze sculpture of a roaring lion” instead of “an animal”).

## 📂 Deliverables

1. Working code for:

   * Dataset preparation (including captions)
   * Model training and inference
2. A script or demo (Colab/Gradio) that:

   * Accepts a seed
   * Generates an image and caption pair
3. Sample outputs
4. A `README.md` describing:

   * Style selected and data cleaning
   * Model architecture and training process
   * Reasoning and tradeoffs
   * How your pipeline could scale to 100k+ generations

---

## 📈 Evaluation Criteria

This task is open-ended and creative, but we’ll evaluate based on:

* ✅ **Scalability**: can it handle large dataset or long training runs?
* ✅ **Multimodal Coherence**: do image and caption match well?
* ✅ **Style Consistency**: is your chosen art style clearly reflected?
* ✅ **Code Quality**: modular, clean, and reproducible
* ✅ **Creativity**: clever architectural or training decisions encouraged!

---

## 🧱 Architecture Tips

* Use **BLIP2**, **OFA**, or **GIT** to caption your dataset before training
* Try **Stable Diffusion + LoRA** for faster finetuning
* Store data in **JSONL** or **Parquet** for long-term scaling
* Log intermediate results with **W\&B**, **TensorBoard**, or custom dashboards

---

## 💡 Bonus Points

* 🎯 Train your model to optionally **condition on prompt + seed**
* 🎨 Make the caption **style-aware** (e.g., baroque vs modernist tone)
* 🔁 Add latent space interpolation for smooth transitions
* 💬 Share a **demo** others can play with!
