# 🎨 Make a Multimodal AI  
*Generate Stylized Art + Captions from a Single Seed*

---

## 🚀 Overview

You're building an AI system that blends creativity and cognition — a **multimodal model** that generates:

- 🖼️ An **image** in a specific artistic style (e.g., oil painting, sculpture, engraving)  
- ✍️ A **caption** that accurately describes that exact image  

Think of it like a GAN that doesn’t just paint, but also explains what it painted — in fluent, human language.

---

## 🎯 Your Mission

Given a seed (latent vector, noise, or random number), your model should generate:

1. An image in a chosen artistic style  
2. A caption that describes the generated image accurately and meaningfully  

You will train your model using a dataset of classical and modern art across styles and mediums.

## 🧠 What You’ll Build

### ✅ 1. Style Selection & Dataset Prep
Choose one specific style (e.g., engravings or oil paintings). Clean and preprocess the relevant portion of the dataset.

- Filter ambiguous samples
- Normalize image size and format
- Remove or label noisy/missing entries

---

### ✅ 2. Captioning Pipeline
Generate descriptive text for each image using a captioning model. Optionally use LLM post-processing to enhance or stylize the captions.

---

### ✅ 3. Multimodal Generation System

Build a model that, **from a random seed**, generates:

- An image in your chosen style  
- A caption for that specific image  

There are many valid approaches. Some ideas:

#### 🎛 Architecture Concept

```text
           ┌──────────────┐
           │  Random Seed │
           └──────┬───────┘
                  │
           ┌──────▼──────┐
           │  Image Gen  │ ◄── Train on stylized art
           │ (e.g. SD,   │
           │   GAN, etc) │
           └──────┬──────┘
                  │ Generated Image
           ┌──────▼──────┐
           │ Caption Gen │ ◄── Trained on your dataset captions
           │  (e.g. BLIP)│
           └─────────────┘
````

You could also explore **joint training** or **token-level fusion**, depending on how deep you want to go.

### 🧪 Sample Pseudocode

```python
# Step 1: Generate image from noise
seed = get_random_seed()
latent = sample_latent_vector(seed)
image = image_generator(latent)

# Step 2: Generate caption for that image
caption = caption_generator(image)

# Output
return {
  "image": image,
  "caption": caption
}
```

## 📂 Deliverables

1. A working end-to-end pipeline

   * Data preparation
   * Image generation
   * Caption generation
2. Sample outputs (image + caption)
3. A `README.md` explaining:

   * Dataset choice + cleaning
   * Architecture + training strategy
   * Scaling strategy
   * Any clever optimizations
4. (Optional) Gradio or Streamlit app to demo the system

## 📈 Evaluation Criteria

We’re evaluating this as a **production problem**, not a Kaggle competition.

### ✅ What Matters:

* **Scalability** — can your pipeline scale to 100k+ samples?
* **Modularity** — is your system extendable and cleanly structured?
* **Quality** — are your images visually consistent? Are your captions relevant and insightful?
* **Creativity** — did you explore novel architectures, loss functions, or caption stylizations?
* **Clarity** — is your reasoning and code well-documented?

> ⚠️ This is subjective and open-ended. Focus on *real-world robustness* over theoretical perfection.

## 🧱 Architecture Suggestions

Some tech stack ideas to help you move fast:

### Captioning

* `BLIP2`, `GIT`, or `MiniGPT-4` for base captioning
* Enhance with LLM (e.g., Claude, GPT) for richness

### Training & Scaling

* `PyTorch Lightning` or `HuggingFace Accelerate` for training
* `Ray`, `Dask`, or `Multiprocessing` for dataset-level parallelization
* `Weights & Biases` or `TensorBoard` for visualization
* Save data in `JSONL` or `Parquet` for future pipeline integration

---

## 💡 Bonus Points

* 💥 Use CLIP-based losses to align images with captions
* 🎨 Stylize captions to match the medium (e.g., poetic, metaphorical, era-specific)
* 🔁 Add prompt conditioning for style variation or mood
* 🌐 Package as a Colab or HuggingFace Space
