# Make a Multimodal AI  
*Generate Stylized Art and Captions from a Single Seed*

## Overview

This project blends generative creativity with semantic understanding. Your goal is to build a **multimodal model** that outputs both:

- An **image** in a selected artistic style (e.g., oil painting, sculpture, engraving).
- A **caption** that accurately describes the generated image.

Both outputs must originate from a **shared latent input** — a single seed. The image and caption should reflect a unified concept, not two disconnected processes.

Dataset for reference:  
[Art Images Dataset — Drawing, Painting, Sculpture, Engraving](https://www.kaggle.com/thedownhill/art-images-drawings-painting-sculpture-engraving)

## Objective

Design a system that can:

1. Generate an image in a specific art style.
2. Simultaneously generate a caption that reflects the content and style of the image.
3. Ensure both outputs are generated from a shared latent representation or seed — not a sequential pipeline.

This is about building a **joint generative system**, where semantics are shared and outputs are inherently aligned.

## What You Will Build

### 1. Style Selection and Dataset Preparation

- Choose one artistic style from the dataset (e.g., engravings, sculptures).
- Clean, resize, and normalize the dataset.
- Use a captioning model (e.g., BLIP2) to generate accurate textual descriptions for each image.
- Align each image with its corresponding caption for training.

### 2. Unified Multimodal Generator

Develop a single model or tightly integrated architecture that, given a random seed, produces:

- A stylized image.
- A grounded caption that describes that exact image.

This should not be a two-stage pipeline (e.g., image → caption). Both outputs must emerge from the same latent representation.

### Suggested Architectures

- **Latent Diffusion Model + Text Decoder**  
  - Use a latent diffusion model to generate images.  
  - Attach a transformer decoder to generate text from the same latent.

- **GAN-based Generator + Caption Head**  
  - Extend models like StyleGAN or VQGAN to output a text embedding.  
  - Train both image and caption outputs from the same noise vector.

- **Multimodal Token Stream Model**  
  - Inspired by DALL·E or Flamingo. Decode both image and text from a single token stream using a shared transformer architecture.

- **Contrastive Latent Mapping**  
  - Generate both outputs from the same seed and align them in shared latent space using a contrastive loss.

> Bonus: Ensure that captions capture not just objects, but also artistic elements (e.g., "an oil painting of a stormy sea" vs. "a wave").

### Sample Interface

```python
# Unified generation from a single seed
seed = get_random_seed()
image, caption = multimodal_model(seed)

return {
  "image": image,
  "caption": caption
}
````

## Deliverables

1. Working codebase for:

   * Dataset preparation and caption alignment.
   * Model training and inference.
2. A script or demo (e.g., Colab or Gradio) that:

   * Accepts a seed.
   * Generates and displays both image and caption.
3. Sample output images and captions.
4. A `README.md` including:

   * Chosen style and preprocessing methodology.
   * Model architecture and reasoning.
   * Training approach and trade-offs.
   * Scalability plan (e.g., supporting 100,000+ generations).

## Evaluation Criteria

Submissions will be evaluated based on the following:

* **Scalability**: Can your system handle large datasets or long training runs efficiently?
* **Multimodal Coherence**: Do the image and caption clearly correspond?
* **Style Consistency**: Is the selected art style reflected reliably in the outputs?
* **Code Quality**: Is the implementation clean, modular, and reproducible?
* **Creative Architecture**: Innovative design decisions are encouraged.

## Technical Recommendations

* Use **BLIP2**, **OFA**, or **GIT** for dataset captioning.
* Experiment with **Stable Diffusion + LoRA** for lightweight image generation.
* Use **JSONL** or **Parquet** to store structured data at scale.
* Track progress and visualizations with **Weights & Biases**, **TensorBoard**, or custom dashboards.

## Bonus Considerations

* Allow conditioning on both prompt and seed.
* Make captions style-aware (e.g., "baroque portrait of...").
* Implement latent space interpolation for smooth transitions.
* Package a shareable demo (Gradio or HuggingFace Space).
